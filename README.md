# Lightweight Distributed RPC Framework

A lightweight C++11 RPC framework built from scratch with **Muduo**, **Protobuf**, and **ZooKeeper**, supporting distributed service registration, discovery, and asynchronous communication.  
Designed for learning and practical use â€” combining simplicity, modularity, and performance.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Distributed Service Registry** â€” uses ZooKeeper to register and discover RPC services dynamically.
- **Protobuf-based Serialization** â€” compact binary protocol for cross-node communication.
- **Event-driven Networking** â€” built on Muduo for non-blocking, multi-threaded TCP I/O.
- **Custom RPC Protocol** â€” `(service_name, method_name, args_size)` format.
- **Client Abstractions** â€” encapsulated `RpcChannel` and `RpcController` for easy remote invocation.
- **High Performance** â€” achieves ~17.5k QPS with 500 threads Ã— 100 requests and 100% success rate.
